# BOT_PYTHON

This is a version of a bot which I once created, it was made for a server of mine which was supposed to be a marketplace for a SNEAKER's Shop. 
The bot was created to allow users easily put their shoes on the market, it was clear, easily accesible and even compatible with many arguments. There was built a function
which scraped infromations from the stockx website which specifies with selling SNEAKERS
